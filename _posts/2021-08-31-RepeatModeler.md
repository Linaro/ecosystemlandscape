  overview: "RepeatModeler is a de novo transposable element (TE) family identification and modeling package. At the heart of RepeatModeler are three de-novo repeat finding programs ( RECON, RepeatScout and LtrHarvest/Ltr_retriever ) which employ complementary computational methods for identifying repeat element boundaries and family relationships from sequence data."
