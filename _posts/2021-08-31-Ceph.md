  overview: "Ceph is an open-source software (software-defined storage) storage platform, implements object storage on a single distributed computer cluster, and provides 3-in-1 interfaces for object-, block- and file-level storage. Ceph aims primarily for completely distributed operation without a single point of failure, scalable to the exabyte level, and freely available. Ceph replicates data and makes it fault-tolerant, using commodity hardware, Ethernet IP and requiring no specific hardware support. The Cephâ€™s system offers disaster recovery and data redundancy through techniques such as replication, erasure coding, snapshots and storage cloning. As a result of its design, the system is both self-healing and self-managing, aiming to minimize administration time and other costs."
