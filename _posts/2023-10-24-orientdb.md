  overview: "OrientDB is an Open Source Multi-Model NoSQL DBMS with the support of Native Graphs, Documents, Full-Text search, Reactivity, Geo-Spatial and Object Oriented concepts. It's written in Java and it's amazingly fast. No expensive run-time JOINs, connections are managed as persistent pointers between records. You can traverse thousands of records in no time. Supports schema-less, schema-full and schema-mixed modes. Has a strong security profiling system based on user, roles and predicate security and supports SQL amongst the query languages. Thanks to the SQL layer it's straightforward to use for people skilled in the Relational world."
