  overview: "kcat is a generic non-JVM producer and consumer for Apache Kafka >=0.8, think of it as a netcat for Kafka.In producer mode kcat reads messages from stdin, delimited with a configurable delimiter (-D, defaults to newline), and produces them to the provided Kafka cluster (-b), topic (-t) and partition (-p).In consumer mode kcat reads messages from a topic and partition and prints them to stdout using the configured message delimiter."
