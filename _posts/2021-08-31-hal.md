  overview: "Virtually all available research on netlist analysis operates on a graph-based representation of the netlist under inspection. At its core, HAL provides exactly that: A framework to parse netlists of arbitrary sources, e.g., FPGAs or ASICs, into a graph-based netlist representation and to provide the necessary built-in tools for traversal and analysis of the included gates and nets."
