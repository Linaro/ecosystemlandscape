  overview: "Pig is a dataflow programming environment for processing very large files. Pig's language is called Pig Latin. A Pig Latin program consists of a directed acyclic graph where each node represents an operation that transforms data. Operations are of two flavors: (1) relational-algebra style operations such as join, filter, project; (2) functional-programming style operators such as map, reduce. "
