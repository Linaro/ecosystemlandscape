  overview: "The Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM) is a general state-space age-structured stock assessment framework designed to include environmental effects on population processes. The state-space framework is attractive because it can estimate observation and process error, as well as naturally propagate random effect parameters in stock projections."
